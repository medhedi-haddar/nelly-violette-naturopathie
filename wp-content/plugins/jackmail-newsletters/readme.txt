== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use Jackmail in WordPress to create and send my newsletters? =
There are lots of newsletters tools inside and outside the WordPress environment. WordPress tools are fully integrated but lack email servers. Outside tools have their email servers but aren't integrated with WordPress (or not enough).
Jackmail unites both to send your newsletters. A fully integrated WordPress tool, with all functions, and an email server.
Jackmail is the perfect solution for your beloved CMS.

= What's the difference between Mailchimp, MailPoet 2 and Jackmail? =
Mailchimp and MailPoet are really good tools, but the first one is not a native WordPress solution and you have to leave WordPress to create your newsletter. The second doesn’t include a SMTP solution and a responsive builder.
With the tools mentioned here above, you need to pay to access all the features and support (only by email). But Jackmail grants all the features, updates and support (email, live chat, phone) for free.
And most of all, we offer manual human checking to ensure your emails have the highest deliverability possible. This is unique in the emailing market and it guarantees the best reputation.

= Why do I need a Jackmail account? =
To send your newsletters, you need email “credits”. A credit is worth an email sent to one recipient. Jackmail allows you to check the number of credits you have and add more if needed.

= Can I create responsive newsletters with Jackmail? =
Jackmail's EmailBuilder lets you create 100% responsive newsletters and guarantees a perfect display on all email web services.

= Is Jackmail compatible with opt-in-forms plugins? =
Jackmail lets you collect email addresses for your newsletters through its widget, but can also connect with others plugins like Contact Forms 7, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms, Bloom, Formidable Forms and more!

We're working on the integration of these form plugins : Caldera forms, WeForms, Captain Forms and Optin Monster.

= What does Jackmail do to avoid my newsletter being delivered in spam? =
